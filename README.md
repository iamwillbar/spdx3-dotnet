# SPDX 3.0-DRAFT Implementation for .NET
## Disclaimer
This is a **PROTOTYPE** implementation of the **DRAFT** [SPDX 3.0 specification](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model) for .NET. Consider this project **ALPHA** (at best) and it may be inconsistent with the SPDX 3.0 specification: either because of changes to the SPDX 3.0 specification or using this project to experiment with possible proposals for the specification.

## Structure
* `Spdx3` - contains the SPDX 3.0 model classes.
* `Spdx3.Serialization` - contains SPDX 3.0 serializers and converters.
* `Spdx3.Tests` - would ideally contain unit tests :grin:.
